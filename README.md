# ST558-finalproject

Brief description of the app and its purpose.

• A list of packages needed to run the app.
```
library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
```

• A line of code that would install all the packages used (so we can easily grab that and run it prior to
running your app).
```
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("caret")
```

The shiny::runGitHub() code that we can copy and paste into RStudio to run your app.
