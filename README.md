# ST558-finalproject

Brief description of the app and its purpose.
• A list of packages needed to run the app.
• A line of code that would install all the packages used (so we can easily grab that and run it prior to
running your app).
```

```

The shiny::runGitHub() code that we can copy and paste into RStudio to run your app.
